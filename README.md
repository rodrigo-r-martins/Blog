This Blog was created as part of a code challenge.

â€¢ Developed an interactive blog web application using React.js, JavaScript, HTML and CSS using the data from JSON Placeholder Rest API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) to simulate initial blog posts, and where users can add, delete, and display their own posts.

To run it use:

<ol>
    <li>npm install</li>
    <ul>
        <li>This command will install all dependencies used in the project;</li>
    </ul>
    <li>npm start</li>
    <ul>
        <li>This command will start the project;</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
